1.  Explain the differences between `client-side routing` and `server-side routing`.

    Server-side routing is requesting information or documents directly from a server based on what is requested; nothing more and nothing less is sent. This can be a bit slow if there is something such as a lack of bandwith. Client-side routing is everything is done by the browser on the page; all the data is stored locally and can display what is needed without triggering a refresh.

1.  Mention three tools we can use to make AJAX requests

    The first tool available in an ajax request is fetch, or .get. This retrieves information from a server so that it is available to use in a web app. A second is .put. This allows you to update information stored in the database on the server. A third is .post. This allows you to create new information stored on the server.
